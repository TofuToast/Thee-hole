    <h3>how to play</h3>
    This is a game where you are basically a random dude who was <br>
    kiddnapped by some shady science company. You are sent to retreve <br>
    something in a giant hole that the facility was built around. <br>
    The hole has floors that you have to beat to progress, where the higher number the floor, 
    the harder it is to beat.<br>

    There is equipment in every floor that you can use to be good.<br>
    You don't need to wear any armor if you don't plan on getting hit.<br>
    So yeah, press the play button to start.=>
    <button id="start_game" onclick="start()">start game</button>
    <h6><em>pls pay attention to the audio or else you're screwed. </em></h6>
